# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that I can work with the skills I have
learned so far, including HTML, CSS, and other requirements from Project0.  The index page is home page and it explains
what my website is about. 

I have used table elements to create a menu that appears on top of each page to help users navigate from page to page.  On the city page I have a link to an image of a site to visit if you visit one of the city.

I beleive all the requirements of Project0 have been fulfilled.
